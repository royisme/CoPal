For detailed usage and safety rules, see global knowledge base: toolsets/project/mcp-serena.en.md and mcp-overview.en.md.
Use Serena to map the project quickly: list entrypoints, services, and modules rather than opening random files.
Ask for key symbols (main functions, routers, initializers) and where primary workflows begin.
Pull call graphs or reference lists to understand how data flows through handlers/services.
Capture findings with file paths and symbol names so later stages know where to act.
If results look empty, confirm the project is activated and the language server is available.
Favor read-only queries now; defer edits until the plan is agreed.
