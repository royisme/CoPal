For detailed usage and safety rules, see global knowledge base: toolsets/project/mcp-serena.en.md and mcp-overview.en.md.
Use symbol and reference search to choose precise touch points for the plan.
Identify which handlers/services will change and list their call sites to estimate blast radius.
Confirm existing interfaces, config flags, and error-handling patterns before proposing edits.
Prefer plans that add helpers or small refactors instead of sweeping rewrites.
If Serena reports missing symbols, double-check project activation and the relevant language server.
Record the planned files/symbols so implement stage can work surgically.
