# Global Principles

1. **Match the user's language** – Respond in the language requested by the user; default to English if unspecified.
2. **Plan before you act** – Produce a plan (and maintain it with `update_plan`) before implementing non-trivial changes.
3. **Prioritise safety** – Follow the approval and sandbox policies of the selected CLI; never bypass manual review for risky commands.
4. **Maintain transparent logs** – Preserve important command output or reference CLI usage logs so the work can be audited later.
5. **Capture new knowledge** – When guidance is missing or a lesson is learned, record it in retrospectives and update project documentation.
