# Prompt Template Placeholder

Use this directory for reusable prompts or conversation starters that are specific to your project.

Example ideas:
- Code review prompt templates
- Planning checklists for recurring tasks
- API contract extraction prompts

Reference your custom documentation and link the templates from `UserAgents.md` or role playbooks so agents know when to use them.
