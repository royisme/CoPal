# Custom Knowledge Base Placeholder

Populate this directory with project-specific knowledge that mirrors `.copal/global/knowledge-base`. For example:

- `core/environment.md` – Project-specific environment or tooling constraints
- `roles/implementer.md` – Frontend/backend conventions for this codebase
- `workflows/deployment.md` – Release playbooks or approval steps
- `toolsets/cli/custom-cli.md` – Documentation for internal tooling

Keeping the structure aligned with the global templates allows agents to override CoPal defaults seamlessly.
