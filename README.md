## Overview

CoPal provides a reusable workflow, knowledge base, and skill management toolkit for teams working with terminal-based AI coding assistants such as OpenAI Codex CLI, Anthropic Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, and similar tools. The project bundles:

- **Six-stage workflow orchestration** (Analyze → Spec → Plan → Implement → Review → Commit)
- **Prompt generation** with stage-specific headers, task metadata injection, and optional MCP guidance
- **Knowledge base templates** for roles, workflows, toolsets, and global policies (YAML front matter for fast retrieval)
- **Project initialisation** via `copal init` to copy AGENTS, UserAgents, and shared knowledge base assets
- **Skill lifecycle tooling** (registry build/list/search, scaffold generation, sandbox-aware execution)
- **Memory layer** that persists decisions, notes, and experiences across workflow runs
- **Utility commands** for MCP discovery, workflow status, and resume hints

The CLI is implemented with the Python standard library and ships with pytest-based tests. All documentation and templates are available in both English and Chinese for international teams.

## Core Features

### 🔄 Six-Stage Workflow
CoPal provides a structured software development workflow:
1. **Analyze** - Understand the task and gather context
2. **Spec** - Write a formal task specification
3. **Plan** - Produce an executable implementation plan
4. **Implement** - Execute the plan and capture changes
5. **Review** - Assess quality and draft PR notes
6. **Commit** - Record workflow metadata

### 📚 Knowledge Base Management

- Workflow guides and best practices
- Customizable project-specific knowledge bases
- YAML front matter for fast retrieval

### 🛠️ Skill System
- Reusable automation modules
- Skill registry and search functionality
- Scaffold generation tools
- Sandbox execution environment
- Skill versioning and sharing

### 🧠 Memory Layer
- Persist decisions and experiences across workflow runs
- Graph-based knowledge storage (using NetworkX)
- Support for decisions, preferences, experiences, plans, and notes
- Memory relationships and querying

### 🔌 MCP Integration
- Model Context Protocol hook system

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/royisme/CoPal.git
cd CoPal

# Install locally (development mode)
pip install -e .

# Or install with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Initialize Your Project

Initialize CoPal in your project root directory:

```bash
# Initialize CoPal assets in current directory
copal init --target .

# Preview what files would be created (dry-run)
copal init --dry-run

# Force overwrite existing files
copal init --force
```

This creates:
- `AGENTS.md` - Root navigation guide
- `UserAgents.md` - Placeholder for project-specific guidance
- `.copal/` - Shared knowledge base, hooks, and MCP metadata

### Configure MCP Tools (Optional)

Declare available MCP tools:

```bash
cat <<'JSON' > .copal/mcp-available.json
["context7", "active-file", "file-tree"]
JSON
```

### Run the Workflow

Execute the six-stage workflow (each command generates prompts in `.copal/runtime/`):

```bash
# 1. Analysis stage - understand the task
copal analyze --title "Add user login" --goals "Implement JWT authentication"

# 2. Specification stage - write specifications
copal spec

# 3. Planning stage - create plan
copal plan

# 4. Implementation stage - execute implementation
copal implement

# 5. Review stage - code review
copal review

# 6. Commit stage - commit changes
copal commit

# Check overall progress
copal status

# Resume interrupted workflow
copal resume
```

## Knowledge Base

The shared knowledge base lives under `copal_cli/templates/base/.copal/global/knowledge-base/` and includes:

- **core/** – Global principles, environment guardrails, and information architecture
- **roles/** – Playbooks for Analyst, Specifier, Planner, Implementer, and Reviewer
- **workflows/** – Step-by-step guides for planning-to-implementation, implementation loops, review and release, and skill lifecycle
- **toolsets/** – Quick-reference guides for common CLIs plus project tooling and guardrail scripts

Projects can override any template by recreating the same path in their repository and linking it from `UserAgents.md`.

## Skill Lifecycle

Skills are reusable automation modules stored under `.copal/skills/` (or a custom root). Each skill contains `skill.json`, `prelude.md`, scripts/tests, and optional logs. Typical lifecycle:

1. Scaffold a new skill with `copal skill scaffold` or the Python API
2. Implement scripts, prompts, guardrails, and tests. Document runtime requirements in `prelude.md`
3. Build the registry (`copal skill registry build`) so teammates can discover the skill via `copal skill search`
4. Execute with `copal skill exec`, passing `--sandbox` if the skill metadata marks it as sensitive
5. Commit the skill directory, `registry.json`, and relevant logs so others can reuse it safely

A higher-level sandbox executor is available via `copal_cli.skills.SkillExecutor`, which runs bash-prefixed commands inside the `LocalSandbox` with output redaction and resource limits.

## Memory Layer Usage

The memory layer allows you to persist important information across workflow runs:

```bash
# Record a decision
copal memory add --type decision --content "Use JWT for authentication" \
  --metadata reason="Secure and scalable"

# Search for related decisions
copal memory search --query "authentication" --type decision

# Update a decision
copal memory update <id> --content "Use JWT and OAuth2"

# Create a follow-up decision (supersedes old one)
copal memory supersede <id> --type decision --content "Switch to OAuth2"

# View all decisions
copal memory list --type decision

# View memory statistics
copal memory summary
```

## MCP Hook System

The MCP hook system injects tool-specific guidance into stage prompts based on the tools declared in `.copal/mcp-available.json`.

### Configuration Example

`.copal/hooks/hooks.yaml`:

```yaml
- id: context7-analysis
  stage: analysis
  any_mcp: ["context7"]
  inject:
    - mcp/context7/usage.analysis.md

- id: active-file-implement
  stage: implement
  all_mcp: ["active-file", "file-tree"]
  inject:
    - mcp/active-file/usage.implement.md
```

Hook blocks are located under `.copal/hooks/mcp/` and contain stage-specific usage instructions.

## Customizing Your Project

After initialization, customize your project:

1. Edit `AGENTS.md` so the "Project Customisation" section points to real documents
2. Populate `UserAgents.md` with project-specific norms and link to any additional docs in the repo
3. (Optional) Mirror `.copal/global/knowledge-base/` to override selected templates with project content
4. Store reusable prompts or playbooks anywhere in the repo and link them from `UserAgents.md`

### Agent Loading Order

When an assistant starts working on the repo it should read, in order:

1. Root `AGENTS.md`
2. `.copal/global/knowledge-base` templates
3. `UserAgents.md`
4. Any docs linked from `UserAgents.md`

This ensures shared templates load first, followed by project-specific overrides.
